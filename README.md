## The Backpage API

Backpage offers a public API to search its classified ad postings.  Developers are free to use it and incorporate the data into their own applications.  Currently read-only access is provided but the ability to post is coming soon.

### Examples

A fully functional demo application has been included to get you started.  You can find the code in the examples folder of the repository.

A jQuery plug-in is provided for your convenience.

We also welcome developers to build their own integration with the XML API directly.
